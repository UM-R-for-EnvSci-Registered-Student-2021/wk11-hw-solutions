  Data are a time-series of pH and carbonate chemistry in
  manually-collected sea water samples from sixteen near-shore locations
  and 20 locations along the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA, and
  intended to benchmark data from moored pH instruments. Data collection
  began in June 2011 and is ongoing. Time-series for pH sensors deployed
  in the field (e.g., SeaFET) are available elsewhere.

      
  Discrete seawater samples were collected by hand or using a Niskin
  bottle. In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for pH (total scale)
  and total alkalinity. Two parameters were used to calculate the full
  suite of carbonate chemistry parameters using the CO2calc algorithms.
  Program outputs are included for laboratory conditions as input, and
  adjusted for situ temperature. See Methods for more information, e.g.,
  Lunden, et al.

      
  Data were collected by a consortium of research groups with the intent
  to leverage their collective assets and expertise. These groups (and
  sponsors) include Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (NSF), OMEGAS Project
  (NSF), Passow Lab (Calif. State Water Board), Hofmann Lab (NSF, CINMS,
  US NPS).

    For subtidal sites, discrete bottles samples were collected by a
    SCUBA diver using a Niskin bottle, firing it manually. For
    intertidal sites, discrete bottle samples were collected in a
    bottle, manually. These data are intended to be benchmark samples
    for continuously recording pH sensors (e.g., SeaFET), and so water
    samples were collected as close to the pH sensor as possible and
    approximately in concurrence with the sensor's voltage measurement.
    Water samples were poisoned with saturated mercuric chloride
    immediately after collection (following SOP1, Dickson et al. 2007),
    sealed, and stored in a cool, dark place until the seawater was
    analyzed.
  
            
    Salinity, pH, and total alkalinity in the water samples were
    measured in the laboratory. Salinity was measured using a benchtop
    conductivity meter (YSI 3100). Seawater pH was measured using a
    spectrophotometric method with indicator dye, unpurified m-cresol
    purple (Sigma-Aldrich, SOP 6b, Dickson et al. 2007). Total
    alkalinity (TA) was measured using an automated, open-cell
    potentiometric titration (SOP 3b, Dickson et al. 2007) with a
    Mettler-Toledo T50 titrator and a DG115-SC pH probe
    (Mettler-Toledo). The probe was calibrated using a Tris buffer (A.
    Dickson Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography). Titrations
    were performed using certified acid titrant (~0.1M HCl, 0.6 M NaCl;
    A. Dickson Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography).
    Certified reference materials (CRMs) from A. Dickson Laboratory,
    Scripps Institution of Oceanography, were used to determine the
    accuracy and precision of the titrations daily before experimental
    samples were measured. Analyzed CRMs were accurate within 10
    micromole kg-1. pH at 25°C, AT,
    temperature, and salinity were used to calculate the pH and
    pCO2 of the treatments using CO2calc (Robbins
    et al. 2010), with CO­2 constants K1, K2 from
    Millero et al. (2006), and pH expressed on the total scale (mol
    kg-SW-1).
  
            
    The CO2calc calculation is programmed in R using package “seacarb”
    and function “carb”.

          The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate
            the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp
              (Macrocystis pyrifera ) forest ecosystems. As in many temperate
            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
            production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic
            interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.
